Do you enjoy going out and socialising, but feel cautious since the
covid-19 pandemic? Are you avoiding crowded and indoor venues? You are
not alone!

Many people are still conscious of the risks of attending
in-person events, especially people who are clinically vulnerable to covid-19 and other infectious diseases.

Breathe Easy Sheffield and Breathe Easy London are both small community groups hosting regular COVID-safer socials and other one-off events. We’re sharing this website to make safer events easier to find, and hopefully inspire you to create your own Breathe Easy group!

## About Breathe Easy

Breathe Easy originated in 2024 with Sheffield organisers Chloe and Jade. Their events have included COVID-safer life drawing, craft socials and cinema visits, as well as the UK’s first COVID-safer gig. They are also developing a local lending library of clean air equipment. For information about their events, visit [sheffield.breathe-easy.uk](https://sheffield.breathe-easy.uk/)

Breathe Easy London is organised by Greta Mauch, Anni, Georgia, and three other London-based COVID activists. COVID-Safe Socials in London started in March 2025 and continue monthly. For more information or to see their events, visit [london.breathe-easy.uk](https://london.breathe-easy.uk/) 

*Breathe Easy London and Breathe Easy Sheffield operate independently and have separate funding, organisers, operations, and practices. We share a belief in harm reduction in event planning. We also share this website and name to make it easier for people  searching for COVID-safer events, to inspire others to create their own, and to build solidarity among COVID-conscious people in the UK*

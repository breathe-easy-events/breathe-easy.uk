/** @module eleventy
 * Eleventy passes a lot of data around with no types so we're going to define
 * some expectations here that our code knows what the contract is.
 *
 * I'm experimenting with making everything optional as much of it seems ot be
 * in 11ty. This means I can run tests with very minimal object deffinitions and
 * still get clues about what shape the data should be in the application.
 *
 * Unfortunately it does not provide and real type safety.
